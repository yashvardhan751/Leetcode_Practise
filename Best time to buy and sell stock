Problem:You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minsofar=prices[0];
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=1;i<prices.length;i++){
            int profit=prices[i]-minsofar;
            if(profit>ans)
                ans=profit;
            minsofar=Math.min(prices[i],minsofar);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
